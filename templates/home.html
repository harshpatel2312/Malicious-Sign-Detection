            <p>
                The project aims to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles by developing a machine learning model capable of detecting and classifying signs with malicious intent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Utilizing advanced computer vision techniques, the model will be integrated into the CARLA simulation environment to test its performance under various conditions, including adverse weather and low-light scenarios. This project addresses critical challenges in autonomous driving technology, such as improving object detection and mitigating potential safety hazards posed by undetected malicious signs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, will be employed to evaluate the model's effectiveness. This work is positioned to advance the field of autonomous vehicle perception, contributing to safer transportation, technological innovation, and potential economic benefits. The project involves collaboration with academia, industry experts, and government agencies to ensure the development of a robust, scalable solution that meets real-world needs.
